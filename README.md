# Overview of Project

## Purpose
Our client W. Avy would like to open a surf shop that also sells ice cream. Prior to making this new business venture, W. Avy would like to look at temperature trends for the months of June and December in Oahu. This will allow them to decide if the shop will be sustainable all year long.

## Results
Here are the below comparison charts of June and December temperatures in Oahu:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>June Temperature Summary</td>
     <td>December Temperature Summary</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><img src="https://github.com/lopezroxann/surfs_up/blob/main/Resources/june_temps.png"</td>
    <td valign="top"><img src="https://github.com/lopezroxann/surfs_up/blob/main/Resources/dec_temps.png"</td>
  </tr>
 </table>


**Three Key Differences:**
- As we can see, typically June in Oahu does run a little bit warmer than it does in December. Although their maximum temps are close (85 and 83, respectively), there is a big difference in their minimum temperature. 
- In June, the minimum temperature is at 64 degrees and then drops down to 56 degrees in December. This can greatly affect sales of ice cream and overall attendance to the surf shop due to colder temps.
- December also has a greater standard deviation than June which means that there are greater fluctuations in temperatures.

## Summary
Temperatures are more favorable in the month of June versus in the month of December in Oahu. Although December temperatures fluctuate a bit more than in June, this should not deter W. Avy from opening their surf and ice cream shop.  Temperatures seem to be quite similar and steady year round that this would not have a great effect on their business. One thing that I would like to see data on would be if there is more rain or stormy weather in June versus December. This could cause shop closures or low customer turnout due to inclement weather. I would also like to see data on wave swells. Maybe one month has more favorable swells that would produce a greater turnout.
